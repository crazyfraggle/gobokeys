# Gobo keys layout for XKB

WIP: Saved this from deletion when erasing my machine.
No idea how well this works.

gobo-symbols should be in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols`

The Gobo key layout is basically a modified en-US layout, with addons for accessing many accented keys through Modifier.

It also maps CapsLock away to be the new modifier key.
